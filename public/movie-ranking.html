<h1>The Best Movies According to Charlotte</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>

<h3>The Haunting in Connecticut</h3>
<p>This is one of my favourite movies. Though it's a horror genre, it is one of the story lines that caught my attention during my younger years.</p>
<h3>The Road</h3>
<p>The twists in this horror movie makes it remarkable. </p>
<h3>As Above, So Below</h3>
<p>Another great movie.</p>
